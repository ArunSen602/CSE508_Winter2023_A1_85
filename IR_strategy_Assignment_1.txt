1.Create a unigram inverted index from scratch of the dataset obtained from Q1.
Ans.
@1Create a data structure that records the occurence of a single word and its associated
list of documents that it appears in. The data structure will contain a key for each distinct
word in the dataset, and for each key, the value should be a list of documents in which the
key appears. The list should be sorted in ascending order.

2.Create a bigram inverted index from scratch of the dataset obtained from Q1.
@1we will need to iterate through the dataset obtained from Q1. For each word in the dataset,
we will create an array
of bigrams from the word and store them in the inverted index. The inverted index will be a 
hash map, with the bigram as the key and the words which contain the bigram as the value.
